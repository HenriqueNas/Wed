/// An immutable 32 bit color value in ARGB format.

/// Consider the light teal of the Flutter logo. It is fully opaque, with a red
/// channel value of 0x42 (66), a green channel value of 0xA5 (165), and a blue
/// channel value of 0xF5 (245). In the common "hash syntax" for color values,
/// it would be described as `#42A5F5`.
///
/// Here are some ways it could be constructed:
///
/// ```dart
/// Color c1 = const Color(0xFF42A5F5);
/// Color c2 = const Color.fromARGB(0xFF, 0x42, 0xA5, 0xF5);
/// Color c3 = const Color.fromARGB(255, 66, 165, 245);
/// Color c4 = const Color.fromRGBO(66, 165, 245, 1.0);
/// ```
///
/// If you are having a problem with `Color` wherein it seems your color is just
/// not painting, check to make sure you are specifying the full 8 hexadecimal
/// digits. If you only specify six, then the leading two digits are assumed to
/// be zero, which means fully-transparent:
///
/// ```dart
/// Color c1 = const Color(0xFFFFFF); // fully transparent white (invisible)
/// Color c2 = const Color(0xFFFFFFFF); // fully opaque white (visible)
/// ```
///

///
///  * [Colors](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Colors-class.html), which
///    defines the colors found in the Material Design specification.
